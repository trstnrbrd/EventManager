  <h1>About This Project</h1>
  <hr />
  <p>
    <strong> <abbr title="Community Event Manager">CEM</abbr></strong
    >! This platform is the result of countless hours of coding, debugging, and
    brainstorming by just – me.
  </p>
  <p>
    I created this app to make event management and discovery simple and
    accessible for communities. Whether you're planning a meetup or looking for
    something fun nearby, this app has got you covered!

  <p>
    As a student, I’m constantly working to improve and add new features, so if
    you spot anything that could be better, let me know. Thanks for stopping by,
    and I hope this project makes managing your events enjoyable!
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m a 2nd year BSIT student, and this project was created as part of my Data
    Structures and Algorithms course.
