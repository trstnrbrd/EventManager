# EventHub - Community Event Manager

EventHub is a simple community event manager built to help people discover, join, and organize local events. This project was created for my Data Structures and Algorithms course as a 2nd year BSIT student.

## Features

- Create Events, from meetups to workshops and small gatherings  
- Discover upcoming community events  
- Book and reserve event slots  
- Clean and simple UI using plain HTML, CSS, and a bit of Bootstrap  
- Django powered backend  

## About

Our professor asked us one question.  
If you want to develop a system or web, what would you do to help the community?

EventHub is my answer. A simple tool to help people connect, organize, and build community activities without stress. Anyone can browse events, book a spot, or host their own.

## Tech Stack

- Backend: Python Django  
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap  
- Database: SQLite  
- Hosting: PythonAnywhere  

## Deployment Notes

This project is deployed using PythonAnywhere.  
Since PythonAnywhere offers free hosting, I need to visit the dashboard every 3 months to keep the web app alive. This makes sure the server stays active and the site remains public.
